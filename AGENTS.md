## Non-code artifacts

Issues, PR descriptions, specs, plans, reviews, and every other non-code artifact give readers the
context and judgment the diff cannot, not a narrated diff or filler, and are published in full on
GitHub. The full rules:

@docs/non-code-rules.md

## PR rules

- Do not merge a PR unless I explicitly ask you to.
- When reviewing a PR, post everything (findings, spec and standards checks, assessment, observations, verification, summary) as one comment on the PR.
- When I ask you to merge a PR, squash-merge by default unless I ask for something else.
- After a PR is merged, clean up local branches and worktrees, fast-forward main, then update and close related issues.

## Git conventions

Never include AI attribution in commit messages, PR titles, or PR descriptions, in any form. That means no

- `Co-Authored-By: ...`
- `Generated with ...` footers
- sign-offs or footers naming an LLM or AI agent (OpenAI, GPT, Claude, Anthropic, and the like)

When squash-merging, write a clean commit message that describes only the change itself.
